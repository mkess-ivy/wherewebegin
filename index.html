				<h3 class="section-title">Inspiration + Concept</h3>
				<p class="section-text wdth-65">
					Where We Begin is an art installation for the one man play, Black Cotton.  Where We Begin's concept is a minimalistic living room setting based on the time period pre-1845.  The living room or living quarters represents an area that is common to the family.  Fertility, Power and Protection are the main points covered in this set.  Where We Begin represents the female energy perspective of Black Cotton, where the characters evolve over time with the living quarters being a representational alter for convening. Fertility represents women whose role has been to take care of the home, to pour energy and life into the household.  Power represents the energy that is conjured in the home -ancestral altars, photos, and other memorabilia; Protection represents the objects and spirits that help block out any negativity. With all three concepts, the living quarters is used as a metaphorical time machine to understand the stories of the characters told in Black Cotton.

				<p class="section-text">Though this living quarters does not reflect the contemporary style of todayâ€™s home, many of our traditions started by just convening in the living room of the home.  Before colonialization, Africans convened and worshipped their ancestors to attain power and protection for their homes.  From altars, to instruments, to sharing food amongst each other, lots of love and wisdom was and still is shared in the living room.</p>
